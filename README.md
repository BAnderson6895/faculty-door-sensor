#Door Sensor Project
**Authors: Benjamin Anderson and Caelin Finn McCool**

###PROBLEM:
Students who are working in PPHAC 114(the Computer Science Lab/Lounge) do not know if the Computer Science professors are in their offices unless they walk over and see if the office doors are open.

###OBJECTIVE:
Make a program that utilizes sensors to detect if a certain office door is open or closed. If a professor is available(their office door is open), a signal in PPHAC 114 will represent that the certain professor is in their office using a constantly updating graphical display. If their door is closed, a different signal will be given for that certain professor showing that they are not in their office at that time.

##Notes:
